This repository was made when I studied this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkrM1gMpqRU&list=PLtXCbh6IFA7QCsei-t8WesusKi8I2LXUJ) taught by the professor [Wendy Suzuki](https://www.wendysuzuki.com) a Professor of Neural Science and Psychology in the Center for Neural Science at New York University.

Her major research interest continues to be brain plasticity. She is best known for her extensive work studying areas in the brain critical for our ability to form and retain new long-term memories. More recently her work has focused on understanding how aerobic exercise can be used to improve learning, memory and higher cognitive abilities in humans.

## What are the major component of the nervous system?
Central nervous system **(CNS)** | Peripheral nervous system **(PNS)**

 ![Central nervous system vs Peripheral nervous system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasileBron/Neuroscience-And-Behavior/master/img/CNS_PNS.PNG)

## 1. What does the CNS is made of and What does it do?
The **Central Nervous System** is made of the **Brain** and the **Spinal cord**.

**Generates behavior** (observed and non-observed)
It **mediates** all **sensory** input and **motor** output.

### 1.1 The brain

### 1.2 Spinal cord
## 1. What does the PNS is made of and What does it do?
The **Peripheral nervous system** is made of the Cranial nerves, Spinal nerves, and Autonomic nervous system.

It carries the **sensory information into the CNS** and the **motor information out of the CNS**.

#### 1.1.1 The 12 pairs of cranial nerves

Listed from the most anterior to the most posterior.

| number | nerves            | type    |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------- |
| 1      | Olfactory         | Sensory |
| 2      | Optic             | Sensory |
| 3      | Oculomotor        | Motor   |
| 4      | Trochlear         | Motor   |
| 5      | Trigeminal        | Both    |
| 6      | Abducens          | Motor   |
| 7      | Facial            | Both    |
| 8      | Vestibulocochlear | Sensory |
| 9      | Glossopharyngeal  | Both    |
| 10     | Vagus             | Both    |
| 11     | Spinal accessory  | Motor   |
| 12     | Hypoglossal       | Motor   |

### 1.2 The spinal cord

### Spinal nerves

31 pairs

- 8 pairs of **Cervical** spinal nerves.

  - 5 in the Cervical plexus
  - 5 in the  Brachial plexus

- 12 pairs of **Thoracic** spinal nerves.

- 5 pairs of **Lumbar** spinal nerves.
- 5 pairs of **Sacral** spinal nerves.
- 1 pairs of **Coccygal** nerves.


plexus =  bundle/hub

### Autonomic nervous system
The Autonomic Nervous system control your organs Unconsciously. It control your body temperature, the blood flow, the heartbeat and so on.

The ANS is made of two component :
The **Parasympathetic** and the **Sympathetic** nervous system.

#Parasympathetic
the cool kid
#Sympathetic
the hyperactive kid





#### Neurones
Dendrites
- input zone
- Receive input from 100+ other neurones
- Many per cell
Axon
- Carries output from cell
- Usually 1 per cell
- Transport chemicals from cell body to terminals
-Transmit electrical impulses to terminals ( speed determined by size, myelin coating)
- Sends outputs to 100+ other neurones




#### Glia
type of Glia
- Astrocytes
- Microglia - multiply at inju
- Oligodendrocytes - make myelin in the CNS
- Schwann cells - make myelin in the PNS

## how neurone communicate?
### Action potential
Cell membrane is a lipid bilayer with two layer of lipid molecule

channels exist within the lipid bilayer, these ion channels are little protein holes that connect the extracellular space to the intercellular space. they span the membrane and allow particular ions to pass and depending to the kind of ions channel it allow the little ions to pass

there is ion channel that are just open all the time.
And there are specialized ion channels called gated ion channel :
- open channel open all the time and allwow only potassium ions (K+) to cros

- volatage gated ion channel only open if the voltage goes to a particular level.

- chemically gated ion channels only open if there is a particular chemical.

- mechanically gated ion channels open with physical force.


The neuron shows selective permeability to (potassium k+) it can enter or leave the cell freely.
The two opposing forces that drive ion movement :

- Diffusion cause ions to flow from areas of high to low concentration, along their concentration gradient.

- Electrostatic pressure cause ions to flow towards oppositely charged areas.
