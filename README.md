This repository was made when I studied this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkrM1gMpqRU&list=PLtXCbh6IFA7QCsei-t8WesusKi8I2LXUJ) taught by the professor [Wendy Suzuki](https://www.wendysuzuki.com) a Professor of Neural Science and Psychology in the Center for Neural Science at New York University.

Her major research interest continues to be brain plasticity. She is best known for her extensive work studying areas in the brain critical for our ability to form and retain new long-term memories. More recently her work has focused on understanding how aerobic exercise can be used to improve learning, memory and higher cognitive abilities in humans.
